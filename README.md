# Robotic-arm-project

Technical Institute project based on a [Dobot Magician](https://www.dobot.cc/dobot-magician/product-overview.html) robotic arm.

## Goals

- Vizualise the arm in real time to preview its collisions
- Taking vectors in input and translate them into angular movements adapted to the robot
- Control the arm from the browser

## Technologies used

- (three.js)[https://threejs.org/] library is used for the 3D model
- WebUSB is used to communicate from arduino to the browser
- Javascript is used to convert vectors into angular movements
